An orthopaedist is a medical doctor specializing in diagnosing and treating disorders related to the skeletal system. Part of their job is to distinguish between a healthy person and a person with Osteoarthritis by looking at their knee X-ray images.



Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis, commonly known as wear-and-tear arthritis, is a condition in which the natural cushioning between joints — cartilage — wears away. When this happens, the bones of the joints rub more closely against one another with less of the shock-absorbing benefits of cartilage. The rubbing results in pain, swelling, stiffness, decreased ability to move, and, sometimes, the formation of bone spurs.
